      <h1>Stephen A. Garney Jr.</h1>
      <p>I lived in Ballston Spa, NY.</p>
      <p>I moved to Syracuse, NY for university.</p>
      <p>I am a field biologist by nature, studying conservation and ecology.</p>
      <p>I am a mountain-lover, a hiker, and appreciate the quiet of nature.</p>
      <p>I am also a nerd who enjoys gaming and great world-building in compelling stories.</p>
      <p>I have a beautiful <a href="Fiance.jpg" img src="Fiance.jpg" alt="Stephen's Fiance"> fiancé</a>, some great <a href="Friends.jpg" img src="Friends.jpg" alt="Stephen's Friends"> friends</a>, and a bombastic baby <a href="Kubo.jpg" img src="Kubo.jpg" alt="Kubo the Ball Python"> ball python</a> named Kubo.</p>
      <p>We hope to have a small farm with some vegetables, goats, pigs, and chickens in the future, because being care-takers gives us life.
      <p>I follow politics and world news, many times to my own dismay and regret.
      <p>I grew up in trailer parks, with a single wonderful<a><imgsrc=# alt=Stephen's Father, Stephen Garney SR.> father</a> for whom I've inherited my namesake and has taught me to be an independent thinker.
      <p>I was raised below the poverty line, and didn't travel much, so I've made it a <a><imgsrc=# alt=Stephen's travels> priority</a> in adulthood.
      <p>I am not fond of outdated formalities, and I prefer to keep an open mind.
      <p>I empassion the work that I care most about, and don't care for monotony.</p>
      <p>I love punk music and baseball, and was a strange <a><imgsrc=# alt=Stephen's Bad Baseball Career> knuckleballer</a> at my small highschool with a class of 80.</p>
      <p>I come from a huge <a><imgsrc=# alt=Stephen's Family> family</a> with 11 siblings, and 35 neices and nephews.
      <p>I still have much to learn about life and my career, but I'm ready to tackle these challenges head on.</p>
      <p>I have a more detailed and professional <a href="/resume.html">résumé</a> if you're more interested in that sort of thing. </p>
